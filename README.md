A Repository to store 3D model objects of JSRF characters.

Feel free to add more models if you are willing to.

I do not own this code, it is simply for personal use in learning to code and use unity. I am choosing to learn through recreating a similar game to one of my favorite games, Jet Set Radio Future.

Current Available Models:
	-Yoyo,
	-Roboy,
	-Rapid 99,
	-Potts,
	-Poison Jam,
	-Noise Tanks,
	-Love Shockers,
	-DJ Professor K,
	-Cube,
	-Corn,
	-Beat,
